* This is a proof of concept of an app that was designed to link charitable causes with advertising units so that anyone could interact with the app and create revenue for their chosen charities without having to spend any money themselves.
* Version: prototype.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Its an Ionic 1 project so 'npm' installing should do it
* You will need to create a free AdMob account with Google and some Ad Units to add to the data to ensure that the right money is tracked
